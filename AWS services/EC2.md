# AWS EC2

Secure and resizable compute capacity for virtually any workload

## Why Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 750 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload. We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking. We offer the best price performance for machine learning training, as well as the lowest cost per inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.

## Benefits of Amazon EC2

- **SLA commitment** : Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- **AWS Nitro System** : Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- **Optimize performance and cost** : Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.
- **AWS Migration Tools** : Migrate and build apps with ease using AWS Migration Tools, AWS Managed Services, or Amazon Lightsail. Learn how AWS can help.

## Use cases

- **Run cloud-native and enterprise applications** - Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
- **Scale for HPC applications** - Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.
- **Develop for Apple platforms** - Build, test, and sign on-demand macOS workloads. Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Train and deploy ML applications** - Amazon EC2 delivers the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects.

## Amazon EC2 Instance Types

- **General Purpose** - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories. 
- **Compute Optimized** - Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. Instances belonging to this category are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications.
