# AWS marketplace 

- It is a curated digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors 
- Easily find, buy, test and deploy software that already runs on AWS.
- The product can be free to use or can have an Associated charge. The charge becomes part of your AWS bill and once you pay, AWS Market pays the provider 
- The sales channel for ISVs and Consulting Partners allow you to sell your solutions to other AWS customers

- Products can be offered such as: 
	- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) 
	- AWS CloudFormation templetes
	- Software as a service (SaaS) offerings
	- Web ACL's 
	- AWS WAF rules 

- I think you need like a US bank account to do it.
