# Intel

- Multinational corporation and one of the world's largest chip manufacturers.
- First - Intel 8086 from 1978

- Another popular instruction set called ARM which uses fewer instructions and usually results in better power efficiency and lower cost 

# Intel Xeon Scalable Processor

# GPU

- GPU stands for Graphical processing unit and it's a processor that is specialized to quickly render high resolution images and videos concurrently 
- if youve ever played video games you know you need a good GPU because it's all about those images 
- however gpus can perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data so they can also be used for non-graphical tasks and this makes it really good for machine learning and scientific computation

- CPUs can have an average of four to 16 processor cores 
- gpus can have thousands of processor cores 
- 4 - 8 gpus can provide as many as 40,000 Cores 

- Useful for - Rendering graphics, Cryptocurrency mining, Depp learning and ML.

# CUDA

- NVIDA - manufactures GPU for gaming and professional markets
- CUDA - compute unified device architecture - it's a parallel Computing platform and API by NVDIA that allows developers to use CUDA-enabled GPU for general purpose Computing on gpus (GP GPU)

- AWS they have a bunch of instances that um can utilize uh Nvidia GPU so I adus is always changing the instances so these could be old:
	- EC2 P3 - 8 NVDIA Tesla V100 GPU
	- EC2 G3 - 4 NVDIA Tesla M60 GPU
	- EC2 G4 - 4 NVDIA T4 GPU
	- EC2 P4 - 8 NVDIA Tesla A100 GPU

- All major deep learning framework are integrated with NVIDIA Deep learning SDK
- One of them is - CUDA deep neural network library (CuDNN)
	- Provides highly tuned implementation for standard routines such as - forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, activation layers
