# AWS S3

- S3 which provides basically unlimited storage 
- You don't need to think about the underlying infrastructure 
- The S3 console provides interface for you to upload and access your data 
- S3 is object storage service you can upload very large files and an unlimited amount of files you pay for what you store you don't worry about the underlying file system or upgrading the disk size


## S3 object 

- Objects contain your data they are like files but objects 
- May consists of:
	- key this is the name of the object 
	- value the data itself made up of a sequence of bytes 
	- version ID when versioning enabled the version of the object 
	- metadata additional information attached to the object 

## S3 buckets 

- buckets hold objects. buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects 
- S3 is a universal name space so bucket names must be unique (it's like having a domain name) 
- An individual object can be between 0 bytes and up to 5 terabytes in size


## Storage classes

- AWS offers a range of S3 storage classes that trade retrieval time, accessibility, durability for cheaper storage and so the farther down we go here the more cost effective it gets

### S3 Standard (default)

- When you put something into S3 it's going to go into the standard tier the default tier
- Incredibly fast, 99.99% availability 11 9's durability and it's replicated across 3 AZ

### S3 intelligent tiering 

- Uses ML to analyze objects and usage and determine the appropriate storage class 
- Data is moveed to the most cost effective access tier without any performance impact or added overhead 

### S3 standard-IA (Infrequent access) 

- This is just as fast as S3 standard but it's cheaper if you access the files less than once a month 
- There's going to be an additional retrieval fee applied 
- If you do try to retrieve data as frequently as S3 standard it's going to actually end up costing you more 

### S3 One-Zone-IA 

- Still fast
- It's running in a single zone so it's as fast as S3 standard but it's going to have lowered availability (99.5%)
- But you're going to save money okay 
- There is one caveat though your data could get destroyed because it's remaining in a single zone so if the data center suffer a catastrophe you're not going to have a duplicate of your data to retrieve

### S3 Glacier

- S3 Glacier so for long-term cold storage for archiving and long-term backup 
- it uses previous generation HDD drives to get that low cost and it's highly secure and durable 
- retrieval of data can take minutes to hour but it's very very very cheap 

### S3 Glacier deep archive 

- The lowest cost storage class but the data retrieval is 12 hours

Note: S3 outpost has its own storage class






Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere

Amazon S3 is object storage where you can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. You can store any type of digital content, from documents and images to application backups and video files. Amazon S3 stores digital files, called objects, in containers, called buckets. Each object you store can be as small as a few bytes or as large as 5 TB. It supports various use cases like data lakes and mobile apps. It offers cost-effective storage options, easy management, and customizable access controls for business and compliance needs.


When you upload a file to Amazon S3, the service automatically creates multiple copies of your data across different locations within your chosen geographic region. This occurs transparently, without any effort on your part. The service manages all the complex infrastructure to make sure your data is always available when you need it.

Amazon S3 provides a basic web interface and API that helps you to store and retrieve your data programmatically. You can integrate this with applications, websites, and other Amazon Web Services (AWS) services.

## What problems does Amazon S3 solve?

Amazon S3 provides a cloud-based solution that eliminates physical infrastructure management. It solves storage scalability, data protection, and accessibility without predicting future needs or managing hardware refreshes. You can focus on using data instead of managing storage infrastructure.

- Global Access with high performance : You can access your data from anywhere worldwide with consistently high performance. The Amazon S3 global infrastructure provides low-latency access through multiple edge locations and AWS Regional endpoints. This makes Amazon S3 suitable for distributed teams and global applications.

- Unlimited storage space: You never have to worry about running out of storage space. Amazon S3 automatically grows with your needs. It can handle anything from a few files to petabytes of data without any infrastructure planning or hardware provisioning on your part.

- Automatic data replication : Your data automatically replicates across multiple data centers within your chosen Region. This design provides 99.999999999 percent durability and protects your data against hardware failures, natural disasters, or other disruptions.

- Security features : Protect your data with security features including encryption, access logging, and fine-grained permissions. You can control exactly who has access to your data using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, bucket policies, and access control lists (ACLs).

- AWS service integration : Amazon S3 integrates with numerous AWS services. Integrations provide the ability to build sophisticated solutions without complex coding or additional infrastructure setup.

- Data organization and management : Organize and manage your data effectively with features like object tagging, metadata, and versioning. You can categorize files, track changes, and implement automated workflows based on your specific needs.


## How much does Amazon S3 cost?

You pay for Amazon S3 based on storage usage, data transfer, and requests. Storage costs depend on the storage class. S3 Standard for frequent access costs more per gigabyte than S3 Glacier for archiving. Some of the cost factors are as follows:

- You are billed monthly for the amount of data stored.
- Data transfers into Amazon S3 are typically free, whereas transfers out incur charges based on volume and destination.
- Transfers between Amazon S3 and other AWS services within the same Region are usually free.
- Operations like writing or retrieving data incur charges per request.
- As part of the AWS Free Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon S3 for no cost.

## Amazon S3 technical concepts
    
Amazon S3 has a basic object-storage architecture. It organizes data using buckets and objects. Buckets hold objects (files) and metadata. Each object has a unique key and can be up to 5 TB in size. Amazon S3 provides immediate read-after-write consistency for all operations. Data is automatically distributed across devices and facilities within your chosen AWS Region, with robust infrastructure handling data replication, security, and access management. Understanding these fundamental concepts helps you work effectively with S3 and use its capabilities for your storage needs.

- Metadata - Metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe an object. This includes system metadata (like object size, creation date) and user-defined metadata that you can add to describe the object.

- Storage class - A designation that determines how Amazon S3 stores and prices your data. Different storage classes offer various combinations of durability, availability, and retrieval times.

- Consistency model - A consistency model is the way Amazon S3 creates data consistency across its distributed system. Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for all operations, meaning any successful write or update will be immediately visible in subsequent read operations.

- Region - A Region is the geographic location where Amazon S3 stores your bucket and its contents. You can choose a Region to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.

## Free Tier

S3's free tier offers a 12 month free trial that provides 5GB of Amazon S3 storage in the S3 Standard storage class; 20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests; and 100 GB of Data Transfer Out each month.
